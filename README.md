## Legit-Game-Engine

Legit Game Engine is a high performance OpenGL/GLFW 2D game engine built in C++.   LGE handles all calls to GLFW's API and allows the programmer to skip much of the tedium associated with setting up an OpenGL project from scratch.  It utilizes a fast 2D Batch Renderer that features texture and color support.  LGE is capable of running ~30,000 textured 2D sprites with little to none noticeable performance drop on average modern hardware.

### About
>*Wait, you made an entire game engine?*

LGE is by far the biggest coding project I've undertaken and is the direct result of hundreds of hours spent reading, tutorial watching, and coding.  The original intent was to build something that would be useful as a tool in creating games, simulations, and other graphics based projects.  However, it's been just as much about learning and getting the experience of building up a graphics/game engine from scratch.  Plus, who doesn't love the feeling of having a final product that feels like it's truly your own?
